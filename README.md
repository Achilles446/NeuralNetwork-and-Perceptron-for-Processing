# NeuralNetwork-and-Perceptron-for-Processing

# THIS PROJECT CONTAINS TWO CLASSES, THE NEURAL NETWORK CLASS AND THE PERCEPTRON CLASS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THAT A NEURAL NETWORK HAS HIDDEN LAYERS, WHEREAS A PERCEPTRON DOES NOT. THE PERCEPTRON CLASS SHOULD BE USED FOR LINEAR TASKS, LIKE PLAYING FLAPPY BIRD. THE NEURAL NETWORK CLASS IS MUCH MORE POWERFUL, BUT YOU SHOULDN'T USE IT WHEN YOU COULD USE A PERCEPTRON

# THE NEURAL NETWORK (NN) CLASS TAKES 3 ARGUEMENTS. A FLOAT[] OF INPUTS, AN INT[] OF HIDDEN LAYERS, AND AN INT OF OUTPUTS. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU MIGHT CALL IT LIKE:
# NN nn;
# float[] inputs = {2, 3};
# int[] hidden = {4, 3};
# nn = new NN(inputs, hidden, 2);
# nn.randomize(); <------- THIS FUNCTION RANDOMIZES THE WEIGHTS AND BIASES IN THE NEURAL NETWORK
# IF YOU'RE USING THIS PROGRAM TO PLAY A GAME, YOU'LL NEED TO CONSTANTLY UPDATE THE INPUTS YOU'RE GIVING THE CLASS. FOR EXAMPLE:
# void brain() {
#   inputs[0] = x;
#   inputs[1] = y;
#   nn.compute(); <------- THIS FUNCTION RUNS THE NEURAL NETWORKS CALCULATIONS. THAT MEANS YOU'LL TYPICALLY WANT TO RUN THE brain() FUNCTION IN draw()
#}

# THE PERCEPTRON CLASS TAKES 2 ARGUEMENTS, A FLOAT[] OF INPUTS AND AN INT OF OUTPUTS. YOU MIGHT CALL IT LIKE:
# Perceptron perceptron;
# float[] inputs = {2, 3};
# perceptron = new Perceptron(inputs, 1);
# perceptron.randomize(); <------- THIS FUNCTION RANDOMIZES THE WEIGHTS AND BIASES IN THE PERCEPTRON
# IF YOU'RE USING THIS PROGRAM TO PLAY A GAME, YOU'LL NEED TO CONSTANTLY UPDATE THE INPUTS YOU'RE GIVING THE CLASS. FOR EXAMPLE:
# void brain() {
#   inputs[0] = x;
#   inputs[1] = y;
#   perceptron.compute(); <------- THIS FUNCTION RUNS THE NEURAL NETWORKS CALCULATIONS. THAT MEANS YOU'LL TYPICALLY WANT TO RUN THE brain() FUNCTION IN draw()
# }

# YOU CAN THEN PULL THE OUTPUTS THROUGH:
# nn.outputs[0] = myVar; <------- THE ARRAY OUTPUTS[] HAS THE NUMBER OF OBJECTS THAT YOU CALLED IN THE CONSTRUCTOR
# OR, IF YOU'RE USING THE PERCEPTRON:
# perceptron.outputs[0] = myVar;

# LASTLY, BOTH THE NEURAL NETWORK AND THE PERCEPTRON HAVE A FEW FUNCTIONS:

# mutate(): TAKES TWO ARGUEMENTS: THE NN/PERCEPTRON YOU WANT TO MUTATE, FLOAT THE CHANCE OF EACH OF THE WEIGHTS AND BIASES BEING MUTATED (MUST BE IN BETWEEN 0-100);

# transfer(); TAKES TWO ARGUEMENTS: THE NN/PERCEPTRON YOU ARE TRANSFERRING, AND THE NN/PERCEPTRON YOU ARE TRANSFERRING TO. USE THIS INSTEAD OF "nn = othernn;"

# breed(); TAKES 8 ARGUEMENTS: THE FIRST PARENT WHICH IS AN NN/PERCEPTRON, THE SECOND PARENT WHICH IS AN NN/PERCEPTRON, INT WHERE YOU WANT TO BEGIN TO SPLICE THE WEIGHTS, INT WHERE YOU WANT TO STOP SPLICING THE WEIGHTS, INT WHERE YOU WANT TO START SPLICING THE BIASES, INT WHERE YOU WANT TO STOP SPLICING THE BIASES, FLOAT THE MUTATION RATE OF THE WEIGHTS AND BIASES DURING CROSS-BREEDING, AND THE NN/PERCEPTRON THAT YOU WANT TO INJECT THE NEW CHILD INTO
